Description: The task is to find a permutation of rows and columns of the matrix, such that a matrix built by shuffling the columns and rows according to the permutations can be partitioned into a minimal set of rectangles. Find all the rectangles as well.
    For illustration, one can think about the problem this way:
    Suppose I have a set of objects and a set of properties. Each object can have any number of (distinct) properties. The task is to summarize (report) this mapping using the least amount of sentences. Each sentence has a form "<list of objects> have properties <list of properties>".
